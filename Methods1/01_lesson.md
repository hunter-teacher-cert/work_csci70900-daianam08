## Lesson objective:
Acquire a basic understanding of methods

### Aim:
What are methods and how can we use methods to return information?

### Warm up
Time: 10 mins

Take a look at the sample code we will be working with today. How does the flow of the code feel to you? What are some ways you think it should be simplified? How will running one part of the code affect another?

### Lesson Content
Time: 15 mins

In this part of the lesson, we will look at sample code and learn about how we can take the work that appears in the main and put it into methods. Methods allows us to simplify code, reuse code in other parts of our code, and manipulate data in a more efficient way. We will do a sample before we break out into pairs to finish the rest of the lab.

### Lesson Activity
Time: 10 mins

Use this time to look through the lab with your partner. You should be able to create 2 more methods(isDivisible and isTriangle). For this session, focus on just one and start the second one if you have time. Formulas have been provided for your convenience. Neither methods take in values but they should return a true or false.

### Closing
Time: 10 mins

Students should submit their work online for review and grading. Review one sample code, 2 if we have time.
