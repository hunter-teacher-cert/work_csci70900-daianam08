Q- Consider a course where NetLogo is used as the primary programming language (or one of them). How would you introduce NetLogo on day 1? Why would you choose to do things that way? 

A- I would use NetLogo to teach coding day one because it is a language that reads like the English language. Java has many syntax rules and punctuation that needs to be used correctly, but it seems NetLogo has a simpler and easier library. Though I hope its introduction doesn't discourage students, NetLogo does offer simulations that are a great connection not only to other subjects but to the real world. I would probably start by showing things like the spread of a virus over time, evolution, or fractals, things that students can relate to or have an understanding of. We would look at the code and see what the syntax looks like. Then I would make a connection to learning other languages(coding or speaking!). While NetLogo is easy to understand, it still has a set of rules to follow. The same logic will apply to the languages we learn in class.
