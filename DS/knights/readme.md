# Knights tour

Write a program to solve the Knights tour, that is, find a sequence of moves such that a knight can visit every square once without repeating. Your program should work on any size board but should be set to default to a 5x5. Note that not all board sizes have solutions and not all board sizes have solutions from all locations.
